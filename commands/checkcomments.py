# .checkcomments/.cc report
\\n\\n
`.checkcomments/.cc` is a [{botname}]({repo}) command that
searches forum threads on SCP Wiki EN for replies you might have missed.
\\n\\n
This report will notify you of any replies to posts that you've made, or
replies to threads that you started. You can also [manually subscribe and
unsubscribe]({subscription_thread}) from threads. {botname} doesn't know which
threads are the discussion pages of articles you've posted â€” hopefully you
started that thread by making an author post. If not, you will need to manually
subscribe to it.
