# .checkcomments/.cc report
\\n\\n
`.checkcomments/.cc` is a [{botname}]({repo}) command that
searches forum threads on SCP Wiki EN for replies you might have missed.
\\n\\n
This report will notify you of any replies to posts that you've made, or
replies to threads that you started. You can also
[manually subscribe and unsubscribe]({subscription_thread})
from threads. {botname} doesn't know which threads are the discussion pages of
articles you've posted â€” hopefully you started that thread by making an author
post. If not, you will need to manually subscribe to it.
