    <p><strong>Important notice!</strong> This documentation is a mixture of prospective and out-of-date. That is to say that the accuracy here is pretty terrible and there's about a 50% chance of anything you read here being true. I'm working on a major documentation update which will hopefully be live soon - poke me whenever to ask how it's going. One day, you'll check back here and see that this notice is gone, and then everything will be guaranteed to be accurate. Thank you, and sorry!</p>
    
    <p>This page contains a huge amount of detail. If you'd prefer a shorter version, see <a href="https://rossjrw.github.io/tars/help/concise.html">Quick Commands</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="whatistars">What is TARS?</h3>
    <p>TARS is an IRC bot primarily for aiding IO in social media promotion, but also has a bunch of other things it can do. The following is a list of all the commands that TARS knows.</p>
    <p>Whenever you see a command such as ``.search``, keep in mind that you can also use this command by pinging TARS at the start of your message: ``TARS: search``</p>
    <p>Command templates: ``.commandname requiredargument [optionalargument] [--tagged taggedargument]``</p>
    <p>"commandname" is the name of the command. "requiredargument" is required. Anything in [square brackets] is not required. Tagged arguments must come after their tag - for example, in the above command ``.commandname requiredargument --tagged taggedargument``        is valid, but ``.commandname requiredargument taggedargument`` is not.</p>

    <h1 id="features">Features</h1>
    <p>Usually TARS is operated with specific commands, but it has some features that aren't command-related.</p>

    <h2 id="scpmatching">SCP-matching</h2>
    <p>TARS will automatically provide a link for a message that's just an SCP number (it'll ignore any pings in the message). It'll also provide a link for a message that contains an SCP number prefixed with "!", e.g. "!SCP-4000".</p>

    <h2 id="chevronning">Chevronning</h2>
    <p>``TARS: ^``</p>
    <p>Tagging TARS in a message that's just a caret (or a chevron) is like saying "TARS, take a good hard look at the last message that was posted". TARS will take a look at the message above the chevron and attempt to parse any command that's there. If it doesn't find anything, it'll move up to the previous message, and will keep doing so until it finds a command.</p>
    <p>Chevronning has a variety of effects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If TARS finds a command that it previously ignored because another bot was present, it will execute it</li>
        <li>If TARS finds a command that starts with the wrong character (e.g. ``!search`` or ``search``), it will execute it</li>
        <li>If the message contains any SCP numbers, TARS will provide links for them all</li>
        <li>If the whole message body, minus any pings, is a match for an article on the wiki, TARS will provide a link for it</li>
        <li>Otherwise, TARS will not do anything.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Append a number after the chevron to change how many messages are checked, e.g. ``TARS: ^ 20``. There is a hard limit of 50, and the default is 10.</p>
    <p>Change the number of chevrons to skip commands. ``^`` will execute the first command that is found, ``^^`` will skip the first command and execute the second command, and so on.</p>
    <p>An empty message that pings TARS and nothing else, eg ``TARS:``, is equivalent to ``TARS: ^ 1``.</p>
    <p>When chevronning, TARS will always ignore any other chevrons.</p>

    <h2 id="joiningleaving">Joining/Leaving</h2>
    <p>TARS will join any channel that it's invited to. This channel will be added to the auto-join list.</p>
    <p>If TARS is kicked from a channel, it will leave, and the channel will be removed from the auto-join list.</p>

    <h2 id="deferral">Deferral (to other bots)</h2>
    <p>If someone posts a command like ``.help`` in a channel, if there are multiple bots there, they may all try to parse it at once! To avoid this, SCP IRC bots are in a hierarchy in which the bot at the top will always try to parse the command,
        and all the other bots will only try to parse it if all the bots above them in the hierarchy are not present.</p>
    <p>jarvis is at the top of the hierarchy. Secretary_Helen is next. TARS is right at the bottom.</p>
    <p>If jarvis or Secretary_Helen are in the channel, TARS will ignore any commands that they would usually pick up on. Look for <span class="jarvis">J</span> and/or <span class="helen">H</span> after the command name to see whether or not this is the case for each command.</p>
    <p>However, if either of those bots fails the request (e.g. not finding anything in a search_) then TARS will automatically try as well. (If TARS also fails to find anything, it won't say anything.)</p>
    <p>To force TARS to parse a command, either ping it at the start of the message, or prefix the command with two dots, e.g. search_. TARS will respond regardless of other bots in the channel (be warned that other bots may respond to any URLs that TARS sends!)</p>
    <p>If your command includes any TARS-specific syntax, then TARS will answer it anyway (in private messages), even if another bot gets there first.</p>
